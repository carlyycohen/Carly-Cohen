# Carly-Cohen

Hi everyone! My name is Carly, and I am a rising Senior at Tufts University. At Tufts, I study Cognitive and Brain Science with a minor in Spanish. I have experience coding in C++, Python, and R. I am currently participating in a breakthrough tech AI fellowship through MIT and Cornell, where I've gotten to focus on solving many real world problems, such as predicting superhosts of airbnbs to creating neural networks to predict handwritten numbers. 

A little bit more about myself - I love to hike, make crafts, and read! I'm also currently a teaching assistant for an Intro Computer Science class at Tufts! I find it super fun and rewarding to connect and help others learn to code. Additionally, I'm on the leadership team for my ultimate frisbee team at Tufts, I'm a tour guide, and I help lead hiking trips through the Tufts Mountain Club! 

Here are a few ways to reach me:
